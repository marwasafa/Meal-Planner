# Meal-Planner

The objective of this project is to create a working Meal Prep Assistant application with a simple user interface that makes preparing meals simple, easy and quick for users.
The application will allow users to cook at home rather than buying food from outside and also save money. We will also implement a shopping list that adds ingredients when the user adds a meal to their meal plan. 
The goal of this project is to create an app that allows users to make meals as fast as possible so they can have time to do other things.
